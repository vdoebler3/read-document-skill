What are you so exdited about Snoopy?  Whats that you're reading?  The Daisy Hill puppy farm is holding a reunion. And They've asked me and my borther Spike... And my sister Belle... and a whole bunch of others to be a part of the reunion and look at this! They're going to have an athletic competition -a triathalon - where we all compete in three events... running... swimming and bike riding.
... And to top it all off - listen to this - they're going to have a dog show. They're going to pick best of breed... and the best in show. They're going to pick a champion beagle! WOW!
