Are you old enough to play any kind of sports?
Or do you follow sports on T.V. or in person?
I Guess we're one of the most sports-watching people on earth. 
Have you ever dreamed of being a big sports star?
Well...I sure have...
Come on, Snoopy.
It's the start of the new baseball season.
The rest of the team will meet us at the ball field.
I guess you know that charlie browns team has a beagle at shortstop...
That's me. 
He has a girl in right field-Lucy.
Who's always talking so much that she forgets to catch the ball. 
He has a second baseman. 
Linus 
Who's always tripping over his security blanket.
And Charlie Brown is both our manager and pitcher.
Peppermint Patty is bringing her team over to challenge us today.
It should be a great game!
There's "The whole gang. Snoopy, Hi. Everybody! Isnt this a wonderful day?
I don't know what all the excitement is about. 
Charlie Brown.
Baseball is...
Baseball is the crack of the bat
The roar of the crowd
The tip of your hat
Baseball is a great pitching match
That's what baseball is!
Baseball is dropping the ball
Always striking out 
Or taking a fall
Baseball is losing
every game
That's what baseball is!
Baseball is as American as jazz
And apple pie
It doesn't matter if you 
lose or win
As long as you give it a try!
Baseball is the crack of the bat
Dropping the ball!
The roar of the crowd
Taking a fall!
The tip of your hat
Always striking out!
Baseball is
A great pitching match!
Losing the game!
That's what baseball is!
Win!...lose!
Draw!...Uhh!
It doesn't matter
As long as ya got 
a pitcher
And a batter
That's what baseball...
It's a joke!
That's what baseball...
An embarrassment!
That's what baseball is...

I tried to stop her. 
Charlie Brown.
Uh-oh. This sounds serious. 
I can tell by the tone of her voice.
What are you talking about Lucy?
We're quitting, Charlie Brown.
We're quitting the team. Me... 
Linus... Sally...
Pig Pen... 
Re-run.
We're all quitting.
She's right, big brother.
All we ever do is lose. 
It's Humiliating.
It has been a pretty ugly sight, Charlie Brown.
I don't believe this.
In fact, Charlie Brown.
We've decided to turn your ball field in to a picnic area to celbrate our freedom from losing all the time.
We're spreading this blanket all over the pitcher's mound, big brother.
And we're going to have a picnic, and I'll sit right next to my sweet Babboo.
Say, They've all brought their lunches in a big picnic basket... 
Looks pretty good, too!
But Peppermint Patty will be here any second with her team. If, were not ready to play. We'll have to forfeit the game.
And I'll look ridiculous.
It just saves a lot of time...
Becuase we'd lose anyway, Charlie Brown.
Besides...There's nothing better than a good old fashioned picnic.

Picnic Basket
Let's pack our picnic 
basket
With lots of things
A checkered tablecloth
Of hopes and dreams
And every snack
And soda
And sandwich tere 
Will be filled up full with 
tender loving care!
Yes, life can be a picnic
If you take the time to fill
your basket right
Life can be a treat
So open up and take 
a bite!

When silly little problems
Havve made you frown
Look for that picnic
basket
And take it down!
Fill it with all your
Favorite things one by one
And your worring days 
are done!
So what if an ant comes
along now and then
Alittle doubt or a fear
We'll concentrate on the 
sunshine
And we won't even notice
he's here!
So anytime you're feeling
A little blue
Packin' a picnic basket's
The thing to do 
Pick only happy things 
And nix the bad
Just believe it and you'll

If you take the time to fill
your basket right
Life can be a treat
A piece of cake!
That can't be beat
So open up 
Open up your heart and 
look to the light
Look to thelight 
And take a bite!!!

Hiya, Chuck!
Hey...What's that all over the ball field?
My team has quit.
And they're celebrating with a picnic.
Poor Charlie Brown. 
I feel so sorry for him when he gets that hopeless look!
Me? 
Manager?
This is my big chance...
To be a sports hero!
Snoopy?
Manager?
Gee, I don't know...
Oh, Don't be so wishy-washy.
Charlie Brown.
Maybe Patty is right we'll give it a try.
Come on, Lucy. 
Get a hit!
Come on sweet Babbo...
Get a hit...
WOW! 
Sally got a hit.
Now. 
The bases are loaded. 
Who's the next batter?
Well...
Here I go to the plate. 
I can eiether be the hero or the goat.
This is your chance Charlie Brown.
If you can get a hit.
We'll score a few runs and go ahead.
WHAP!
Boy, Do we have a great manager!
It was nothing.
Uh, Oh...
What was that?
Gee, Look at those dark clouds it looks like it's going to rain.
OH, NO! 
We'll have to stop playing the game. 
We're getting soaked.
Good Grief. 
I finally get a hit...
We finally are about to win a game...
And the whole thing was washed out.
My big chance to be a sports' hero just went down the drain.
Come on, Big Brother look at the bright side, you actually got a hit!
And I have to admit that the dumb beagle here, did a good job managing.

Friends

Friends, friends, friends we'll always be friends 
No matter what happens to us 'till the end
We'll always be friends

Palls, pals, pals we'll always be pals
No matter what years from now somehow
we'll always be pals

Even when we disagree we know no one's to blame
Cause in spite of our differences we're really just the same!
And we'll always be...

Sometimes we say things we don't mean to say 
Or do things we don't mean to do 
We end up huring when all we really wanted
was love
And though we may act like a bull or a lion
We'd stop if only we knew
That deep down inside of all of us
Is a precious dove so let's always be...

You know Chuck, I sure am glad you're my friend
Thanks, you guys are about the best friend anyone could ask for Slurrp!
You too Snoopy...I love you my friend
I love you too...

Well, we didn't win this one.
But, you know, we did come closer than we ever did before. 
We Played better than we ever have...Charlie Brown got a hit...
Got to be manager...And we all have high hopes for the rest of the season.
All in all...A pretty good day for the gang. We'll, I've gotta go help Charlie Brown
wash the mustard off his glove.

See you around...and remember, keep your eye on the ball.

The end
